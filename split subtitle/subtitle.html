	790
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:29,064
And then add to that.

791
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:32,651
Where do you vacation? What are your
allergies? Who'd you have an affair with?

792
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:33,986
The only way this works. ..

793
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:37,823
...is if you believe that you're these people
so much that you dream like them.

794
00:59:38,783 --> 00:59:40,492
Get started tonight.

795
00:59:41,202 --> 00:59:44,204
I'll be back tomorrow.
We'll get going. Good luck.

796
00:59:49,794 --> 00:59:51,503
Well, my guy kind of sucks.

797
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:53,046
What's your name?

798
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:56,049
Mike McEwan, eh? Heh.

799
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:58,051
That was convincing.

800
00:59:58,219 --> 00:59:59,886
Kathy, what's your name?

801
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:31,084
The Love Boat
will be seen 15 minutes from now.

802
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:35,047
The State Department insisted today
that the crisis in Afghanistan...

803
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:39,301
...will not divert the attention of the
United States from the plight of the hostages.

804
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:42,179
--is perceived to be if not impotent,
then at least reluctant....

805
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:46,850
Now the United States finds itself in such
bitter confrontation with the Soviet Union...

806
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:49,853
...over that country's invasion
of Afghanistan....

807
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:52,481
The United States
is now moving toward a decision...

808
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:54,691
...to boycott the Summer Olympics
in Moscow....

809
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:59,071
Bad news, bad news.
Even when it's good news, it's bad news.

810
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:03,575
John Wayne's in the ground six months,
this is what's left of America.

811
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:35,732
"The Minister of Culture and Guidance
has approved your location scout.

812
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,818
He will send his representative to meet
you and your crew...

813
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:41,571
...at the Khayyam entrance
to the Grand Bazaar tomorrow at 3 p.m."

814
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:43,615
They called your bluff.

815
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:46,368
- Maybe they're cooperating.
- Absolutely not.

816
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:51,164
Seven Americans walking the bazaar
is asking for a riot. It's the hive.

817
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:52,666
Seven Canadians, Jack.

818
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:55,961
Never give them multiple shots at a cover.

819
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:57,963
Are they even ready?

820
01:01:58,131 --> 01:01:59,381
They're getting there.

821
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:01,091
There's no prize for "Most Improved."

822
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:03,969
I don't have a choice.
We say no, they show up at the residence...

823
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:06,763
...and drag everyone out.
You think their covers are gonna hold up. ..

824
01:02:06,931 --> 01:02:08,765
...when they're getting their fingernails
pulled out?

825
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:32,789
You want us to go to the Grand Bazaar
at 3:00 in the afternoon?

826
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:36,877
You said a day to learn our covers,
then straight to the airport.

827
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:38,670
They suspect something?

828
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:41,590
What I know is,
we need to pretend to be a movie crew.

829
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:45,177
We go to the bazaar today,
we fly out from the airport tomorrow.

830
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:48,680
We won't do it.

831
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:53,185
He told them that there were six of us.
So they're expecting six.

832
01:02:53,352 --> 01:02:55,562
It would be suspicious
not to show up at this point.

833
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:57,856
What else do we have to do, all right?

834
01:02:58,024 --> 01:03:00,567
He's about to show them
the only cards that we're holding. ..

835
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:04,404
- ...which is that they don't know we're here!
- That's the ball game, okay?

836
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:06,698
Look, we don't have any other choice!

837
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:09,201
Who says that we'll know our covers
well enough?

838
01:03:09,368 --> 01:03:11,119
We're not in the CIA.

839
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:13,872
It's suicide.

840
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,124
I'm asking you to trust me.

841
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:18,710
I don't trust you.

842
01:03:21,255 --> 01:03:23,799
This is the game, Joe.
What world are you living in?

843
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:27,594
The one where they're hanging people
from construction cranes, Bob.

844
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:30,847
It's too dangerous.
I won't bring my wife into the bazaar.

845
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:34,267
Joe?

846
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:42,818
So we'll see you at 2.

847
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:10,762
So don't be recognizable
but look exactly like your passport photo.

848
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:14,474
I haven't been this nervous
since our wedding.

849
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:18,353
Only this isn't a huge mistake, hopefully.

850
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:21,690
Sorry. Okay.

851
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:31,783
Hello?

852
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:39,958
Who was that?

853
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:45,005
- Mark?
- Yeah?

854
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:48,884
I'm scared.

855
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:52,470
It's okay.

856
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:41,519
Where are they?

857
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:43,021
In the kitchen.

858
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:03,416
This is what I do. I get people out.

859
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:07,754
And I've never left anyone behind.

860
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:11,800
I wish I could believe you, Mr. Harkins.

861
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:20,225
My name is Tony Mendez.
I'm from New York.

862
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:23,144
My father worked construction.
My mother teaches elementary school.

863
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:25,689
I have a wife and a 10-year-old son.

864
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:32,779
You play along with me today,
I promise you, I will get you out tomorrow.

865
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:38,868
Fuck.

866
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:21,327
Shit.

867
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:49,856
Hang on.

868
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:39,656
You all right?

869
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:47,080
Okay. Tell me who you are.

870
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:50,041
Mike McEwan, cameraman.

871
01:08:50,584 --> 01:08:52,794
Robert Baker, director.

872
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:55,255

01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:01,261
Sean Bissett, associate producer.

876
01:09:01,428 --> 01:09:03,972
All right. Let's go make a movie.

877
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:19,279
Welcome, welcome.
My name is Reza Bolhani.

878
01:09:19,446 --> 01:09:21,823
- Kevin Harkins. I'm the producer.
- Nice to meet you.

879
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:23,616
This is Mike McEwan, our cameraman.

880
01:09:23,784 --> 01:09:25,994
This is Tim.
This is Mary, our screenwriter.

881
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:27,662
And this is our director, Bob Baker.

882
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:29,581
- You are the director?
- Yes.

883
01:09:29,748 --> 01:09:32,208
Is this film a foreign-bride film?

884
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:34,419
Sorry?

885
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:37,046
A film where a foreign bride comes to Iran. ..

886
01:09:37,214 --> 01:09:40,758
...but she doesn't understand the language
or the customs...

887
01:09:40,926 --> 01:09:43,469
...and there is misunderstandings
and laughs.

888
01:09:43,637 --> 01:09:45,096
Oh, no.

889
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:55,773
The bazaar in Tehran
is one of the largest in the world.

890
01:09:56,358 --> 01:10:00,528
This bazaar has been on this spot
for over 8000 years.

891
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:04,908
You can find many items
such as paper, spices...

892
01:10:05,117 --> 01:10:07,619
...precious metals, all right here.

893
01:10:07,786 --> 01:10:08,995
Right this way, please.

894
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:15,752
This way.

895
01:10:30,851 --> 01:10:32,143
- Uh, Mike?
- Yeah.

896
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:36,481
If I was to say you're looking through the
wrong end of that viewfinder, would I be right?

897
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:40,360
Yup.

898
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:48,701
Just a little further.

899
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:21,943
Please wait here. Let's stay together.

900
01:11:38,752 --> 01:11:40,503
He wants the photograph you took.

901
01:11:40,671 --> 01:11:43,756
It's okay, it's her job to take photographs.
She's the production designer.

902
01:11:43,924 --> 01:11:47,176
He says he did not give you permission
to take a photograph of his store.

903
01:11:47,344 --> 01:11:50,013
That's okay. You can tell him he can have it.

904
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:53,391
Please, please, just take the photograph.

905
01:12:03,193 --> 01:12:04,235
Peace be upοn yοu.

906
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:05,778
And upοn yοu, sir. Welcοme.

907
01:12:05,946 --> 01:12:07,196
I hοpe yοu are well.

01:12:07,364 --> 01:12:09,032
Τhank yοu very much. Hοw are yοu?

909
01:12:09,241 --> 01:12:11,617
I'm very well. What's yοur name?

910
01:12:11,785 --> 01:12:12,952
Sahar.

911
01:12:23,964 --> 01:12:27,133
He's saying that the shah killed his son
with an American gun.

912
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:39,187
No, no, no! No! Canada!

913
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:40,396
Canada!

914
01:12:40,564 --> 01:12:42,857
I would like to suggest that we end our visit.

915
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,284
Yοu knοw, sister...

916
01:12:53,452 --> 01:12:57,455
...thοse whο are with him, Rasοοl οf Allah,
we are tender amοng οurselves.

917
01:12:57,623 --> 01:12:59,165
But stern against the Kufar.

918
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:01,209
As Gοd wills it.

919
01:13:02,836 --> 01:13:06,047
But thοse whο sit silently have sinned.

920
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:09,509
Hοw else may I help, sir?

921
01:13:09,676 --> 01:13:12,011
Nο, nο, just οne thing.

922
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:15,515
Hοw lοng have they been here?

923
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:17,809
Pardοn?

924
01:13:19,144 --> 01:13:20,853
The guests of the Ambassador.

925
01:13:20,854 --> 01:13:22,230
The guests of the Ambassador.
How long have they been here?

926
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:26,692
Τhey arrived twο days agο.

927
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:32,198
Fοrgive my intrusiοn, οne must be vigilant.

928
01:13:33,492 --> 01:13:36,369
Everyοne in this hοuse is a friend οf Iran.

929
01:14:10,904 --> 01:14:12,363
How'd it go?

930
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:15,616
What about tomorrow?

931
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:18,494
Tomorrow they'll be ready.

932
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:24,709
For Kennedy, a stunning turnaround...

933
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:26,919
...one week after humiliation in Illinois.

934
01:14:27,087 --> 01:14:28,379
I love New York.

935
01:14:29,756 --> 01:14:32,300
And I love Connecticut too.

936
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:35,094
How did he win here? Well, he had help.

937
01:14:35,262 --> 01:14:39,891
I'm responsible for anything
that goes wrong in this government.

938
01:14:40,058 --> 01:14:44,103
A man in Scranton is placing a flag
in his lawn for every day of captivity.

939
01:14:45,105 --> 01:14:48,232
When he runs out of lawn,
Kennedy wins the primary.

940
01:14:48,775 --> 01:14:51,194
The six with the Canadians
are coming out.

941
01:15:02,247 --> 01:15:03,831
Who signed off on this?

01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:06,792
- You. Where was your passport issued?
- Vancouver.

943
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,252
- Where were you born?
- Toronto.

944
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:10,421
"Torono." Canadians don't pronounce the T.

945
01:15:10,589 --> 01:15:13,007
Some Komiteh guard
is actually gonna know that?

946
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:16,969
If you're detained for questioning, they will
bring in someone who knows that. Yes.

947
01:15:17,137 --> 01:15:20,348
Mary, who were the last three prime ministers
of Canada?

948
01:15:20,807 --> 01:15:23,309

01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:29,482
- Where were you born?
- Halifax, Nova Scotia.

952
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:31,400
What's your date of birth?

954

955
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:38,783

01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:40,451
- Who paid for that?
- CFDC.

957
01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:42,954
What's your middle name?
What's your middle name?

958
01:15:43,121 --> 01:15:44,830
- Leon?
- Shoot him. He's an American spy.

959
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:50,294
Look, they're gonna try to break you, okay?
By trying to get you agitated.

960
01:15:50,462 --> 01:15:52,588
You have to know your résumé
back to front.

961
01:15:52,756 --> 01:15:57,093
You really believe your little story's gonna make
a difference when there's a gun to our heads?

962
01:15:58,011 --> 01:16:01,180
I think my story's the only thing
between you and a gun to your head.

963
01:16:04,518 --> 01:16:05,560
Okay.

964
01:16:10,774 --> 01:16:13,734
Hey, they made it through
the location scout.

965
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:27,373
You have a call.

966
01:16:38,302 --> 01:16:39,343
What is it?

967
01:16:39,511 --> 01:16:40,595
Go to black on green.

968
01:16:43,307 --> 01:16:44,390
Go.

969
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:46,017
- It all just changed.
- What?

970
01:16:46,184 --> 01:16:48,769
- They're calling the game. You gotta come back.
- What?

971
01:16:48,937 --> 01:16:51,647
Joint Chiefs are planning
a military rescue of the hostages.

972
01:16:51,815 --> 01:16:54,358
Delta Force has started training
to storm the grounds.

973
01:16:54,526 --> 01:16:56,402
So if the six of them...

974
01:16:56,570 --> 01:17:00,197
...are brought down there,
they won't be held for long.

975
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:04,744
Fuck. Goddamn it. I never would have exposed
them if I wasn't authorized to get them out.

976
01:17:04,911 --> 01:17:07,622
- It's over, Tony.
- If they stay here, they will be taken.

977
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:12,543
- Probably not alive.
- Listen to me. The thinking has changed.

978
01:17:12,711 --> 01:17:16,380
Six Americans get pulled out
of a Canadian diplomat's house and executed...

979
01:17:16,548 --> 01:17:18,466
...it's a world outrage.

980
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:21,594
Six Americans get caught playing
movie make-believe...

981
01:17:21,762 --> 01:17:24,430
...with the CIA at the airport and executed?

982
01:17:24,598 --> 01:17:29,477
It's a national embarrassment.
They are calling the operation.

983
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:34,273
We're responsible for these people.

984
01:17:35,275 --> 01:17:38,069
What we are is required to follow orders.

985
01:17:38,945 --> 01:17:40,321
I'm sorry.

986
01:17:49,706 --> 01:17:51,082
Fuck!

987
01:17:57,923 --> 01:17:58,964
Come in.

988
01:18:00,592 --> 01:18:02,176
Ready to try again.

989
01:18:04,429 --> 01:18:07,181
You're ready. You worked hard.

990
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:11,227
Probably the best thing to do for you
right now would be...

991
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:13,521
...just to relax.

992
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:15,398
Okay.

993
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:17,400
You did good.

994
01:18:18,318 --> 01:18:19,610
Thanks.

995
01:18:31,998 --> 01:18:35,292
Scorched-earth policy tonight.

996
01:18:37,003 --> 01:18:38,838
Nothing gets left.

997
01:18:45,971 --> 01:18:47,388
So you know.

998
01:18:49,182 --> 01:18:52,977
ExtAff wants you to burn the passports
before you leave.

999
01:18:55,147 --> 01:18:59,150
If we tell them now, they'll panic.
I think it's best if you just don't show.

1000
01:19:01,653 --> 01:19:03,696
It was always a fucked mission.

1001
01:19:04,364 --> 01:19:06,657
You came closer than anybody else.

1002
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:22,923
If it keeps on rainin'
Levee's goin' to break

1003
01:19:24,342 --> 01:19:30,014
When the levee breaks
I'll have no place to stay

1004
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:39,977
Ahem. It's off.
They want us to pack up the office.

1005
01:21:41,688 --> 01:21:43,814
This can wait. Let's go get a drink.

1006
01:22:09,132 --> 01:22:11,050
He's late.

1007
01:22:24,481 --> 01:22:25,522
O'Donnell.

1008
01:22:25,690 --> 01:22:26,941
Somebody's responsible...

1009
01:22:27,108 --> 01:22:28,943
...when things happen, Jack.

1010
01:22:29,611 --> 01:22:31,153
I'm responsible.

1011
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:33,948
- I'm taking them through.
- Tony?

1012
01:22:43,875 --> 01:22:48,295
Alan. Alan. We need to confirm those
seven tickets out of Tehran on Swissair.

1013
01:22:48,463 --> 01:22:50,756
- N.E. shut that down.
- I say it's back on.

1014
01:22:50,924 --> 01:22:53,676
- I can't do it. It's backstopped.
- Hey, wait a minute.

1015
01:22:53,843 --> 01:22:56,845
What the hell you talking about, backstopped?
What the hell's that mean?

1016
01:22:57,013 --> 01:22:59,807
Carter's gotta say yes for us
to get the tickets.

1017
01:23:09,609 --> 01:23:10,818
It's time to go.

1018
01:23:21,162 --> 01:23:22,204
All right.

1019
01:23:23,957 --> 01:23:26,750
- Where's Engell?
- He's in a meeting.

1020
01:23:26,918 --> 01:23:29,837
- Pull him out.
- Uh.. ..

1021
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:31,171
Pull him out!

1022
01:23:31,339 --> 01:23:33,173
Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.

1023
01:23:33,758 --> 01:23:35,426
- Thank you.
- See you soon.

1024
01:23:35,593 --> 01:23:37,511
- Sahar's on a bus.
- Great.

1025
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:39,096
Sahar will be fine.

1026
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:41,015
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1027
01:23:41,266 --> 01:23:44,518
- You two leave right now, right?
- We'll be on a train in half an hour.

1028
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:45,769
Good.

1029
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:50,566
N.E. said no.

1030
01:23:50,734 --> 01:23:55,404
This is not a long leasher, and it never
has been, and you don't decide if it goes!

1031
01:23:55,572 --> 01:23:56,780
It is going!

1032
01:23:56,948 --> 01:23:58,949
Jack, you are this close.

1033
01:23:59,117 --> 01:24:00,993
Am I? Am I really that close?

1034
01:24:01,161 --> 01:24:03,120
You are this goddamn close to the line
with me.

1035
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:06,832
I am not gonna leave him at the airport
with six people and his dick in his hand.

1036
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,461
You tell the director to call the White House.
Do your fucking job!

1037
01:24:19,095 --> 01:24:20,179
Get to your plane, Claude.

1038
01:24:27,187 --> 01:24:30,647
First time anyone's gonna ask you
a question is at the first checkpoint.

1039
01:24:31,316 --> 01:24:33,817
The first checkpoint is just
to get a look at your passports.

1040
01:24:34,194 --> 01:24:37,988
Passports came straight from Ottawa
last week. They're clean.

1041
01:24:38,406 --> 01:24:40,240
Find the White House chief of staff.

1042
01:24:40,408 --> 01:24:41,492
How would I find him?

1043
01:24:41,659 --> 01:24:44,661
We're a fucking spy agency! Find him!

1044
01:24:45,413 --> 01:24:48,749
The second checkpoint is immigration.

1045
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:50,667
You're each gonna hand them one of these.

1046
01:24:50,835 --> 01:24:53,420
It says that you landed in the country
two days ago.

1047
01:24:54,172 --> 01:24:57,007
They'll look for the matching white one,
which doesn't exist.

1048
01:24:57,175 --> 01:24:58,967
You'll say you don't know what happened.

1049
01:24:59,135 --> 01:25:01,053
And if you believe they lost the white slip...

1050
01:25:02,305 --> 01:25:03,388
...they'll believe it too.

1051
01:25:04,265 --> 01:25:07,351
Jordan's in the West Wing.
He's not taking calls.

1052
01:25:08,853 --> 01:25:10,354
Where are his kids?

1053
01:25:10,522 --> 01:25:11,563
What?

1054
01:25:11,731 --> 01:25:13,273
Where do his kids go to school?

1055
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:21,782
Thank you, thank you.

1056
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:24,201
Pace Academy, Buckhead, Georgia.

1057
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:28,622
White House.

1058
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:33,377
Yes, this is Mr. Murphy from Pace Academy
calling for Mr. Jordan.

1059
01:25:33,545 --> 01:25:35,879
Yeah, I'm afraid it is an emergency.

1060
01:25:36,047 --> 01:25:38,257
Hold for the chief of staff's office.

1061
01:25:38,466 --> 01:25:41,009
The third checkpoint is the trap.

1062
01:25:41,177 --> 01:25:42,803
It's manned by the Revolutionary Guard.

1063
01:25:43,429 --> 01:25:45,681
Most of them were educated
in the U.S. or Europe.

1064
01:25:46,224 --> 01:25:49,101
And all of whom are looking for Americans.

1065
01:26:00,947 --> 01:26:01,989
Hello?

1066
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:03,949
- Jack O'Donnell, from C.I.
- Wait, wait, who?

1067
01:26:04,117 --> 01:26:07,911
Tehran Houseguest operation is ready now.
We don't have the president's go-ahead.

1068
01:26:08,079 --> 01:26:10,164
They are going to be captured.

1069
01:26:10,331 --> 01:26:11,456
David, pick up!

1070
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:31,643
Zurich. It's under Harkins.

1071
01:26:39,819 --> 01:26:42,487
I'm sorry, sir, I don't seem
to have these reservations.

1072
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:47,951
Telex on flash.

1073
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:50,954
Would you mind checking again, please?

1074
01:26:59,631 --> 01:27:02,382
Copy D.S. Confirm the tickets! Go!

1075
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:17,481
My apologies. It just came through.

1076
01:27:25,156 --> 01:27:26,865
Swissair says they picked up the tickets.

1077
01:27:27,033 --> 01:27:29,701
Get the L.A. office,
tell them to be ready in case they call.

1078
01:27:29,869 --> 01:27:31,995
We told them to shut that down.

1079
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:04,528
There you go.

1080
01:28:21,379 --> 01:28:22,796
Not here.

1081
01:29:26,027 --> 01:29:27,778
When did you come to Iran?

1082
01:29:28,321 --> 01:29:30,113
Two days ago.

1083
01:29:30,281 --> 01:29:31,948
What was the purpose of your visit?

1084
01:29:33,034 --> 01:29:35,619
We are looking for locations for a film.

1085
01:29:42,418 --> 01:29:43,502
We have a--

1086
01:29:43,669 --> 01:29:48,548
Oh, yeah. I've got a letter
from the Ministry of Culture.

1087
01:29:49,467 --> 01:29:51,718
If you want to take a look at that. All right?

1088
01:30:11,906 --> 01:30:13,949
- Ahem.
- You can go.

1089
01:30:23,501 --> 01:30:25,168
Come on, come on.

1090
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:42,144
Swissair Flight 363
is now boarding Rows 18 to 35.

1091
01:31:16,554 --> 01:31:18,805
We're going to. ...

1092
01:31:47,335 --> 01:31:51,046
We're together, yes.
The six of us, we're from Canada.

1093
01:31:52,548 --> 01:31:54,633
Purser's telling Swissair
they're not on the plane.

1094
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:56,301
They should have boarded already.

1095
01:31:56,469 --> 01:31:58,053
Still no answer in L.A.

1096
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:24,287
Sir.

1097
01:32:34,298 --> 01:32:37,801
Yes, it's a fantasy story
about a war in another world.

1098
01:32:37,969 --> 01:32:39,678
Here you can see our notices.

1099
01:32:43,975 --> 01:32:45,850
Of course I speak Farsi.

1100
01:32:46,018 --> 01:32:48,228
I wish to make a film in Iran.

1101
01:33:04,996 --> 01:33:08,456
No, I'm the writer.

1102
01:33:08,666 --> 01:33:10,542
Kevin, give me the storyboards.

1103
01:33:11,127 --> 01:33:15,171
These are the drawings that show
what we will film for the movie.

1104
01:33:15,339 --> 01:33:18,008
Alien villains have taken over the hero's planet.

1105
01:33:18,175 --> 01:33:21,344
They fight for their families and
take back the city.

1106
01:33:21,512 --> 01:33:27,851
The villains know he is the chosen one,
so they kidnap his son in the spice market.

1107
01:33:29,395 --> 01:33:32,022
So he and his wife storm the castle.

1108
01:33:32,189 --> 01:33:39,195
The people... hold that... the people are inspired tojoin him.
They are farmers, but they learn to fight.

1109
01:33:42,950 --> 01:33:44,743
They shoot weapons at their enemies.

1110
01:33:48,956 --> 01:33:52,208
And the king of the aliens is destroyed
when the people find their courage.

1111
01:34:01,385 --> 01:34:03,511
You don't go until we verify.

1112
01:34:08,059 --> 01:34:10,101
I understand.

1113
01:34:10,269 --> 01:34:12,437
Sir, you can call our office.

1114
01:34:12,605 --> 01:34:13,938
They'll verify.

1115
01:34:39,215 --> 01:34:42,050
- It'd go all the way throughout the '30s.
- We're shooting right now.

1116
01:34:42,218 --> 01:34:46,096
- We're just going to the Producers Building.
- Yeah, I understand. We're shooting right now.

1117
01:35:20,131 --> 01:35:23,842
Swissair announces
final boarding for Flight 363 to Zurich.

1118
01:35:31,809 --> 01:35:33,560
Reset! We're back to one.

1119
01:35:33,728 --> 01:35:35,687
- All right, reset.
- We're going again!

1120
01:35:35,855 --> 01:35:38,857
- We're just right at the Producers--
- Right away, everyone! And rolling!

1121
01:35:39,024 --> 01:35:41,317
- We're going to the Producers Building.
- We're rolling.

1122
01:36:17,646 --> 01:36:20,607
Sorry, pal. We're gonna be in the movie.
Call my agent.

1123
01:36:20,816 --> 01:36:22,108
Sir!

1124
01:36:34,038 --> 01:36:36,039
Studio Six Productions.

1125
01:36:36,957 --> 01:36:39,375
May I speak to a Mr. Kevin Harkins?

1126
01:36:39,543 --> 01:36:43,713
I'm sorry, Mr. Harkins is out of country
on a location scout. May I take a message?

1127
01:37:01,357 --> 01:37:04,776
Doors are closing for Flight 363 to Zurich.

1128
01:37:13,035 --> 01:37:14,244
We can go.

1129
01:37:23,462 --> 01:37:25,630
You keep these. It's a gift.

1130
01:37:53,117 --> 01:37:54,284
Miss.

1131
01:39:58,909 --> 01:40:00,910
Swissair 363, clearance for taxi?

1132
01:40:04,081 --> 01:40:07,583
Swissair 363,
you are number two for departure.

1133
01:40:14,925 --> 01:40:18,761
Ladies and gentlemen, from
the flight deck, we are number two for takeoff.

1134
01:40:55,966 --> 01:40:58,885
Swissair 363, you are cleared for takeoff.

1135
01:41:02,973 --> 01:41:04,849
Swissair 363, cleared for takeoff.

1136
01:42:10,165 --> 01:42:11,207
We got wheels up.

1137
01:42:11,750 --> 01:42:12,792
Wait.

1138
01:42:28,392 --> 01:42:31,060
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is our pleasure to announce...

1139
01:42:31,228 --> 01:42:34,939
...that alcoholic beverages are now available
as we have cleared Iranian airspace.

1140
01:42:39,945 --> 01:42:41,445
I love you.

1141
01:43:23,488 --> 01:43:25,781
They're clear. Ha-ha-ha!

1142
01:43:25,949 --> 01:43:27,450
Yes! Yes!

1143
01:43:28,327 --> 01:43:30,453
- Yeah!
- Yes!

1144
01:43:30,621 --> 01:43:31,787
Yeah, man.

1145
01:43:32,247 --> 01:43:33,956
They're out!

1146
01:43:34,124 --> 01:43:37,335
- They're out! They're out!
- We got them out!

1147
01:43:40,672 --> 01:43:41,797
They're out!

1148
01:43:46,178 --> 01:43:47,803
Yes!

1149
01:43:47,971 --> 01:43:50,139
Great work, boys.

1150
01:43:50,307 --> 01:43:51,307
We did it!

1151
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:06,489
You are admitted to the Republic of Iraq.

1152
01:44:51,034 --> 01:44:52,868
We made history tonight.

1153
01:44:54,037 --> 01:44:57,373
History starts out as farce
and ends up as tragedy.

1154
01:44:57,916 --> 01:44:59,542
Quote's the other way around.

1155
01:45:00,210 --> 01:45:02,712
- Yeah, who said it?
- Marx.

1156
01:45:03,630 --> 01:45:04,672
Groucho said that?

1157
01:45:09,219 --> 01:45:11,721
Call the Times, nail it to the goddamn door.

1158
01:45:11,888 --> 01:45:13,597
CIA are the good guys.

1159
01:45:13,765 --> 01:45:15,599
The Canadians are the good guys.

1160
01:45:15,767 --> 01:45:17,476
Yeah, we're not greedy. Them too.

1161
01:45:18,228 --> 01:45:22,732
Only. Canada takes the credit,
or they retaliate against the hostages.

1162
01:45:23,567 --> 01:45:25,401
Great Satan wasn't involved.

1163
01:45:26,153 --> 01:45:28,154
No CIA.

1164
01:45:28,363 --> 01:45:29,905
Is that right, Jack?

1165
01:45:32,075 --> 01:45:33,784
Involved in what?

1166
01:45:34,786 --> 01:45:37,288
We were as surprised as anybody.

1167
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:41,959
Thank you, Canada.

1168
01:45:42,169 --> 01:45:44,837
We knew that each day they stayed there...

1169
01:45:45,005 --> 01:45:47,673
...the danger was becoming greater.

1170
01:45:47,883 --> 01:45:51,927
We had been looking for a solution to have them
leave the country during the past three months.

1171
01:45:52,095 --> 01:45:54,764
Day 87, and finally a sliver
of really good news.

1172
01:45:54,931 --> 01:45:58,726
The U.S. Department of State
hereby honors Joe Stafford. ..

1173
01:46:00,228 --> 01:46:01,645
...Kathy Stafford...

1174
01:46:02,939 --> 01:46:04,648
...Mark Lijek.. ..

1175
01:46:05,275 --> 01:46:10,488
We Americans will be forever grateful
to our great friend and ally to the north...

1176
01:46:10,655 --> 01:46:14,909
...for the protection and the safe passage
provided for our diplomats.

1177
01:46:15,077 --> 01:46:16,327
Bob Anders.

1178
01:46:16,495 --> 01:46:19,205
Here, or anywhere in the world...

1179
01:46:19,373 --> 01:46:20,956
...Canada will pay...

1180
01:46:22,292 --> 01:46:26,295
...for this violation
of the sovereignty of Iran.

1181
01:46:26,463 --> 01:46:30,674
Thank you to Pat and Ken Taylor
and the great nation of Canada.

1182
01:46:34,513 --> 01:46:37,223
So I'm sitting in Jerry's this morning,
I'm having breakfast.

1183
01:46:37,391 --> 01:46:40,476
Waitress comes over to me,
she's waving a newspaper, and she says:

1184
01:46:40,644 --> 01:46:44,021
"You see what those Canadians pulled off?
Why can't we do something like that?"

1185
01:46:44,815 --> 01:46:46,649
And I said to her-- Do you know what I said?

1186
01:46:47,067 --> 01:46:48,192
No, what?

1187
01:46:48,735 --> 01:46:50,194
"Argo fuck yourself."

1188
01:47:18,974 --> 01:47:20,015
All set.

1189
01:47:20,976 --> 01:47:22,351
Thanks a lot.

1190
01:47:33,488 --> 01:47:34,488
Ha!

1191
01:47:35,866 --> 01:47:39,368
Heh. And I left my autograph book at home.

1192
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,709
His Eminence called me.

1193
01:47:46,877 --> 01:47:48,085
He wants to see you.

1194
01:47:48,587 --> 01:47:50,296
Probably wants to fire me himself.

1195
01:47:51,423 --> 01:47:53,757
He wants to give you the Intelligence Star.

1196
01:47:54,968 --> 01:47:56,802
You're getting the highest award of merit. ..

1197
01:47:57,012 --> 01:48:00,347
...of the Clandestine Services
of these United States.

1198
01:48:01,308 --> 01:48:03,225
Ceremony's on the 14th.

1199
01:48:03,393 --> 01:48:06,562
If they push it a week, I can bring lan.
That's his winter break.

1200
01:48:08,064 --> 01:48:12,401
The op was classified,
so the ceremony's classified.

1201
01:48:12,569 --> 01:48:15,613
He can't know about it.
Nobody can know about it.

1202
01:48:17,157 --> 01:48:20,242
So they're just gonna give me an award
and then they're gonna take it back.

1203
01:48:20,827 --> 01:48:21,869
That's right.

1204
01:48:23,747 --> 01:48:26,081
If we wanted applause,
we would've joined the circus.

1205
01:48:27,792 --> 01:48:29,919
- I thought we did.
- Ha.

1206
01:48:30,587 --> 01:48:33,380
Carter said you were a great American.

1207
01:48:34,090 --> 01:48:35,758
Great American what?

1208
01:48:36,301 --> 01:48:37,760
He didn't say.

1209
01:48:51,107 --> 01:48:52,358
What happened to your picture?

1210
01:48:53,985 --> 01:48:55,194
It's in turnaround.

1211
01:49:37,487 --> 01:49:39,071
Can I come in?

1212
01:50:25,076 --> 01:50:35,878
The Iran Hostage Crisis ended on
January 20, 1981, when all remaining
hostages were released.
They spent 444 days in captivity.

1213
01:50:37,422 --> 01:50:47,556
The involvement of the C.I.A. complemented efforts of the
Canadian embassy in freeing the six held in Tehran.
To this day, this story stands as an enduring
model for international cooperation between
governments.

1214
01:50:48,975 --> 01:50:55,397
All of the Houseguests returned
to the U.S. Foreign Service after
their ordeal in Iran.

1215
01:50:56,941 --> 01:51:06,909
Oscar-winning makeup artist
John Chambers was awarded the C.I.A.'s
Intelligence Medal, its highest civilian honor.
He and Mendez remained friends
until Chambers' death in 2001.

1216
01:51:08,703 --> 01:51:15,668
Tony Mendez's Intelligence Star was returned
to him in 1997, when the Argo operation was
declassified by President Clinton.

1217
01:51:25,720 --> 01:51:33,686
He lives in rural Maryland with his family.

1218
01:53:26,132 --> 01:53:31,136
They went in, as you know, under
the guise of creating a motion-picture film.

1219
01:53:31,346 --> 01:53:35,974
But that it had a very high possibility
of failure.

1220
01:53:36,142 --> 01:53:38,435
And after it was successful, of course...

1221
01:53:38,603 --> 01:53:41,396
...it was a great temptation
to reveal all the stories...

1222
01:53:41,564 --> 01:53:44,983
...so maybe I could take a little bit
of credit for it, since I was president...

1223
01:53:45,151 --> 01:53:49,738
...but we had to keep it secret.
Tony Mendez has gone down in CIA history...

1224
01:53:49,906 --> 01:53:51,782
...after his retirement...

1225
01:53:51,950 --> 01:53:58,789
...as one of the 50 most important
CIA operatives of all time.

1226
01:53:59,415 --> 01:54:04,795
Eventually we got every hostage
back home, safe and sound...

1227
01:54:04,963 --> 01:54:08,966
...and we upheld the integrity of our country,
and we did it peacefully.
